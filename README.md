# Digital ethnicity data in population-wide electronic health records in England: a description of completeness, coverage, and granularity of diversity

## Project description

Inequality in health has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where people from ethnically diverse backgrounds were disproportionately affected. But we know inequity is not limited to the pandemic as it is a long-standing, multi-faceted issue.

An example is technology   for predicting a personâ€™s future health risks. This involves routinely collected health information, which is fed into a computer model which in turn produces a health risk score for a patient, and that is used by doctors to decide patient care. If there is bias in the data or bias in the model, the doctor can potentially make wrong decisions and patients can get the wrong care or no care, meaning some groups of patients might inappropriately be prioritised over other for booster vaccines, hospital beds, or life-saving treatments, which in turn can affect patient and public trust, and cost the NHS. 

This proposal aims to improve existing technology for predicting personalised future risk of health conditions, particularly those affecting overlooked groups of patients. We aim to do so by a) improving the way recorded ethnicity is used in research, and b) improving the modelling process to build risk prediction models tailored to ethnicity groups and therefore more reliable in practice. 

We propose to develop a calculator to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in COVID-19 patients as an example to demonstrate our approach, as here ethnic biases are known to exist. As inequity in data and models affects all disease areas, our approach is sustainable and can be applied to other clinical areas in the NHS. The calculator can be used by public to guide lifestyle choices, and by doctors to provide better care.

The publicly available algorithm for improving information on ethnicity can be used by researchers nationwide doing health research involving ethnicity. 

This work will be based on anonymised health information that represents almost everyone currently living in England. By extending to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in future, we hope that this work will help to make health equal and fair for everyone in the UK.
